# README

This script/application just updates your TV show database to fix a bug in plex,
which causes the show URLs to become incorrect.

Adapted from discussion in this "thread":http://forums.plexapp.com/index.php?showtopic=4608
and an Applescript by "gauvins":http://forums.plexapp.com/index.php?showuser=2745

Converted to ruby, and simplfied, since I hate applescript.

A backup is created, in the same directory, in case something goes wrong.

/Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/Plex/userdata/Database

The backup file is MyVideos34.db.backup.  Trash the 'MyVideos34.db' file and drop the '.backup'
from the backup, and you should be back to an unbroken state.

# Usage

Either download the script "plex_tv_fix.rb" and run it via Terminal, or download the
"Platypus":http://www.sveinbjorn.org/platypus packaged script (plex_tv_fix.zip), unzip and run it.

You have to run it as the user you run Plex as, and it should just find the appropriate file
and work.

It doesn't need any extra installs, as OSX comes with Ruby and the required sqlite3 library.

Oh, and you probably shouldn't run it when Plex is running.  I have no idea how that will work.
